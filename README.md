# gophers-in-space
Basic tutorial on graphql in go ... with gophers in space.

What is it?
Graphql is a query language for APIs developed by Facebook.

Why use it?
- one call
- define percisely the data you want

How a graphql server is used:
- As a main server (ie CRUD)
- As a microservice that exposes data. Business logic lives in other services written in many languages

## Pre-requisites

This examples in this repo depend on:
- [Gorilla mux](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux): use to route and dispatch requests
- [graphql-go](https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql): graphql server library implemented in go

Install them running

`$ go get github.com/gorilla/mux` and `$ go get github.com/graphql-go`

## To run it

After installing the deps, you can start the application browsing to the root folder (ie example_1, example_2) and running `$ go run main.go`

## To make requests

No apollo today :( ...

Instead we will make our queries and mutations with [altair](https://github.com/imolorhe/altair), a graphql client.

install with brew cask:
`$ brew cask install altair-graphql-client`


## Code Organization

./example_1
example 1: implement using [graphql-go/graphql](https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql)
We create the graphql objects and define the resolvers.

./example_2
example 2: implement using [graph-gophers/graphql-go](https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go)
Pick a library that will manage splitting the schema and mutations in seperate files with autogenerated code.

./example_3
example 3: api exploration

How to graphql
- Study examples, and think about how the front end views data
- Make it obvious with names: Query vs Mutation
- Focus on writing the schema, types, and the resolvers

My Setup
- VSCode: .gqlconfig file in my project directory, used by [graphql-for-vscode](https://github.com/kumarharsh/graphql-for-vscode). This allows autocomplete.
- Altair, alternatives are: [Insomnia](https://github.com/getinsomnia/insomnia), [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)
