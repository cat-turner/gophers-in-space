# gophers-in-space
Basic tutorial on graphql in go ... with gophers in space.

What is it?
Graphql is a query language for APIs developed by Facebook.

Why use it?
- one call
- define percisely the data you want

How a graphql server is used:
- As a main server (ie CRUD)
- As a microservice that exposes data. Business logic lives in other services written in many languages

## To make requests

No apollo today :( ...

Instead we will make our queries and mutations with [altair](https://github.com/imolorhe/altair), a graphql client.

install with brew cask:
`$ brew cask install altair-graphql-client`


## Code Organization

./example_1

Implement using [graphql-go/graphql](https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql)

We create the graphql schema, types, and define the resolvers.

./example_2

Lib implements it for you [99designs/gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen)

Pick a library that will manage splitting the schema and mutations in seperate files with autogenerated code.

### Pre-requisites

This examples in this repo depend on:
- [Gorilla mux](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux)
- [graphql-go](https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql)
- [99designs/gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen)

Install them by running:

example_1

`$ go get github.com/gorilla/mux`

`$ go get github.com/graphql-go`


example_2

`$ go get github.com/99designs/gqlgen`

### To run it

After installing the deps, you can start the application by browsing to the root folder.

example_1

`$ go run main.go`

example_2

implement notes in README.md

`go run ./server/server.go`

How to graphql
- Study examples, and think about how the front end views data
- Make it obvious with names: Query vs Mutation
- Focus on writing the schema, types, and the resolvers

Dev Tools
- Altair, alternatives are: [Insomnia](https://github.com/getinsomnia/insomnia), [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)
